<h4 align="center">A speedrunning-approved version of LEGO Island Rebuilder.</h4>

## Info

This is a barebones version of LEGO Island Rebuilder that is intended for speedrunners. It only contains options that are approved by the [LEGO Island speedrunning community](https://speedrun.com/li), limiting modification of LEGO Island's code to only what's necessary to cap the frame rate.

This version can also happily co-exist alongside upstream Rebuilder, as its settings are stored separately from Rebuilder's.

Like upstream Rebuilder, it supports [all known versions of LEGO Island](https://www.legoisland.org/wiki/index.php/LEGO_Island_Versions).

## Download

The latest binaries are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/Ramen2X/RebuilderSR/releases/tag/continuous).
